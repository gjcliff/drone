# drone
The origins of this project date back to 2020. I was screwing around with an old, cheap quadcopter (the JRC HC6). I was pretty bad at controlling it using the hand-held controller, and wanted to figure out a way to script flight commands so I didn't have to do anything. My first idea was to try and intercept and decipher the radio communcation between the controller and the drone, however this was pretty much impossible to do without an expensive tool, such as a software defined radio capable of receiveing signals of at least 2.4GHz. Back then, I didn't know of the existence of the wonderful [HackRF Software Defined Radio (SDR)](https://greatscottgadgets.com/hackrf/one/), so I decided to build my own drone instead.
I started with very little knowledge and experience, and I worked extremely hard to get where I am with the project today. As far as I know, the code works very well. I've confirmed the radio communication works flawlessly, within a certain range of course, and that the yaw, pitch, and roll values are responsive, accurate, and have minimal drift. My tests of the PID loop library have also been successful. The one thing I have been struggling with is the physical electronics. Lesson learned: don't cheap out on your motor drivers. I've had seemingly unlimited mysterious problems from using knock-off version of the DRV8833 motor driver. At the moment, I think I'm close to figuring out my problems, but I won't rule out the possibliity of more mysterious problems.
Here's a picture of my drone in its current state, note that it's missing the radio module in this picture.
