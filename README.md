# drone
The origins of this project date back to 2020. I was screwing around with an old, cheap quadcopter (the JRC HC6). I was pretty bad at controlling it using the hand-held controller, and wanted to figure out a way to script flight commands so I didn't have to do anything. My first idea was to try and intercept and decipher the radio communcation between the controller and the drone, however this was pretty much impossible to do without an expensive tool, such as a software defined radio capable of receiveing signals of at least 2.4GHz. Back then, I didn't know of the existence of the wonderful [HackRF Software Defined Radio (SDR)](https://greatscottgadgets.com/hackrf/one/), so I decided to build my own drone instead.
